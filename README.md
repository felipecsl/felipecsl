### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Felipe and I currently live in Seattle, where I'm often hanging out with my dog Chaves, 
my girlfriend, playing soccer or writing code. I'm enthusiastic about modern programming 
languages with sound type systems. Nowadays I mostly write Kotlin, Ruby and Javascript.
I'm also into functional programming, Rust and Haskell.

I've worked with Android for several years, most of them at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com), 
but right now I'm taking a break from full time mobile development, focusing instead on 
backend development at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and building [a new project](https://stocks.dog) 
for the stock market and investing. I'm looking to collaborate on that and other side projects,
so please get in touch if you're interested!

You can reach out to me via e-mail and I'll try my best to get back to you. If at first I
don't reply, try emailing me again ðŸ™‚. You can ask me about carrer in tech, diversity, 
being a latino ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· living in the US, keto, investing or anything else that you might find
interesting!

I'm also into contributing to open source. Sometimes I write short articles on 
[my blog](https://felipecsl.com).
