### OlÃ¡! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Felipe and I often split my time between US and Brazil.
I'm enthusiastic about functional programming.
My go-to languages these days are usually Kotlin, Ruby or Typescript.

I've worked with Android development for several years, many of them at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com).

Most recently, I've worked at:
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com) building payments infrastructure
* [QuickNode](https://quicknode.com) building their [Ethereum NFT](https://www.quicknode.com/nft-api) 
and [token APIs](https://www.quicknode.com/token-api)
* [Alza](https://alza.app) building a neobank for the latino population in the US

I'm currently taking a break from full-time work to spend time reading, reasearching,
exploring new technologies and working on [Huskly Finance](https://huskly.finance).

I'm also a regular contributor to open source and write semi-regularly on [my blog](https://felipe.lima.gl).

Cheers! â˜•
