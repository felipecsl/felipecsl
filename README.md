### OlÃ¡! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Felipe and I often split my time between US and Brazil.
I'm enthusiastic about functional programming.
My go-to languages these days are usually Kotlin, Ruby or Typescript.

I currently work at [Eppo](https://geteppo.com) on experimentation, analysis, feature flagging and building their SDKs.
Occasionally, I hack on [Huskly Finance](https://huskly.finance).

Places I've recently worked at:

* [Alza](https://alza.app) (now defunct) building a neobank for the latino population in the US (2023)
* [QuickNode](https://quicknode.com) building their [Ethereum NFT](https://www.quicknode.com/nft-api) 
and [token APIs](https://www.quicknode.com/token-api) (2022)
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com) building payments infra for Latin America (2019-2021)
* [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) building the Airbnb Android app (2015-2019)

I'm also a regular contributor to open source and write semi-regularly write on [my blog](https://felipe.lima.gl).

Cheers! â˜•
