### OlÃ¡! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Felipe and I currently live in Seattle ðŸŒ§, where I'm often climbing, running, biking, 
hanging out with my girlfriend, playing soccer or writing code. I'm enthusiastic about 
modern programming languages with sound type systems. Nowadays I mostly write Kotlin, 
Ruby and Typescript. I'm also into functional programming, Rust and Haskell.

I've worked with Android for several years, most of them at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com).
Most recently, I've worked at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) building payments infrastructure.

I currently work at [QuickNode](https://quicknode.com) building the future of internet and web3.

You're welcome to reach out to me via e-mail. I usually reply to non-spammy e-mails sent by 
humans. You can ask me, for example, about starting a carrer in tech, diversity, being a 
latino ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· living in the US, nutrition, minimalism, crypto, investing or anything else that 
you might find interesting!

I'm also a regular contributor to open source. You can find more content on [my blog](https://felipecsl.com).
