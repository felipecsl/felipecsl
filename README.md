### OlÃ¡! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Felipe and I currently live in Seattle ðŸŒ§, where I'm often climbing, running, biking, 
hanging out with my wife, playing soccer or writing code. I'm enthusiastic about 
modern programming languages with sound type systems. Nowadays I mostly write Kotlin, 
Ruby and Typescript. I'm also into functional programming, Rust and Haskell.

I've worked with Android for several years, most of them at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com).
Most recently, I've worked at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) building payments infrastructure
and at [QuickNode](https://quicknode.com) building their [Ethereum NFT](https://www.quicknode.com/nft-api) 
and [token APIs](https://www.quicknode.com/token-api).

As of Aug, 2022, I'm taking a break from full-time work to spend time reading, reasearching,
exploring new technologies and working on [Huskly Finance](https://huskly.finance).

I'm also a regular contributor to open source. You can find more content on [my blog](https://felipecsl.com).

Cheers! â˜•
